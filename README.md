## Wins
- Successfully incorporated and leveraged data from an unfamiliar API to enrich the application's capabilities.
- Worked quickly and efficently in order to produce a well-rounded and clean application.
## Challenges & Improvements
- I dealt with a very peculiar bug, where my create react app did not initialize properly, Which resulted in my dependencies not getting installed, and about 2 hours into this challenge I was having some issues that I didn't know how to reconcile.  When I finally checked my dependencies I noticed that there was nothing there, I tried to npm install but nothing happened, I ended up having to  move everything into a new app, I lost a lot of time to this unfortunately. 
  - Possible future improvements and features:
    - I unfortunately was unable to get around to Cypress testing, so I would very much like to go through and do that.
    - As of right now I only have the ability to look at the first 100 results from the news api, I would like to implement the ability to look at more pages.
